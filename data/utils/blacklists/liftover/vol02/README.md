Settings used to create liftOver

Minimum ratio of bases that must remap: 0.5

"Allow multiple output regions" was switched OFF because:

By default, liftOver does not return a match if the region is split in the new assembly. 
If LiftOver can map a region more than once, and this setting isn't on, there will be no output for the region. 
Consider checking this option for conversions involving high-quality data within the same species. 
This option should not be used when mapping large regions, doing cross-species conversions, or using fragmented poor-quality assemblies.
